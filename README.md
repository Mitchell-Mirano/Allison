Allison: is a library  of Artificial Intelligence

# About Allison

This project implements the main machine learning and deep learning architectures in Python, 
using libraries such as Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib for the visualizations. 
its objective is to show how machine learning works
inside and not be a black box for many people.

## Requirements
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Pandas
## Install
- clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Mitchell-Mirano/Allison.git`
- install a virtual environment `python -m virtualenv env`
- install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can use Allison

## Example of Allison in Google Colab
Clone the repository, import the requirements, 
import  a model of Allison, for this example use Kmeans and select your features for train.

Grahp your features, choose how many centroids you want to find, create a model object with Kmeans,
train your model using  method train.Then I get your new labels and centroids
